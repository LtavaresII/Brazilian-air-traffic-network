# Brazilian-air-traffic-network

This is a study on brazilian air traffic, in order to analyze the data in graphs, using networkx, we will verify the assortativity of the graph using the attribute "region", analyze the assortativity related to degree, both in Brazil and their regions, analyze the connected components of both Brazil and their regions and create a travel scenario to determine the shortest path of a route of five cities.

# Preparing the Data

# Part 1: Assortativity Graph

# Part 2: Degree Assortativity

# Part 3: Connected Components

# Part 4: Walks, Paths and Distances
